<h3 id="org60f7995">General</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org60f7995">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The purpose of a portfolio is to demonstrate your engineering experience to employers/graduate school admissions committees.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics">Northwestern MSR program</a> requires that you maintain a public portfolio in order to graduate.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The MSR program website links to all <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/people/students/">student and alumni portfolios</a>.</li>
<li>We periodically feature <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/curriculum/featured-project-portfolios.html">exeptional portfolios</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many portfolios are exceptional, but due to space limitations not all of these can be featured.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>At minimum, your portfolio must contain at least 3 projects:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fall Quarter Group Project</li>
<li>Individual Winter Project</li>
<li>Individual Final Project</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Most (if not all) successful MSR students greatly exceed these requirements.</li>

<h3 id="orgf3d518d">Front Page</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf3d518d">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The front page of your portfolio should immediately make your projects visible and accessible.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each project should have a compelling picture or animation, descriptive text, and link to a page with further details.</li>
<li>Each project page should have its own separate url so that specific projects can easily be shared with others.</li>
<li>Avoid making readers take an action (such as moving the mouse or clicking) to see your projects and the high-level description.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other items appropriate for a portfolio include:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>About Me</li>
<li>Contact (including LinkedIn profile)</li>
<li>Resume</li>
<li>Other Interests</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="org894e3fd">Requirements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org894e3fd">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Each project should contain, at a minimum:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An edited video showing your project working.</li>
<li>A brief description of the project.</li>
<li>One or more graphics (such as a block diagram) outlining the general technical structure of the project.</li>
<li>A brief discussion of the main technical points, in a hierarchical format:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rather than a large block of text, break up the project into meaningful section headers and sub-headers</li>
<li>A reader should be able to get an overview of your project by reading the overall titles and get more details the lower-down the hierarchy they go.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A conclusion or discussion of the results.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>
2.If a project was done in a group then you must:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Make clear that the project was a group project and acknowledge your group members by name. (Failing to do so is a violation of the <a href="./honor_code.html">Honor Code</a>).</li>
<li>Emphasize and discuss your role.</li>
</ul>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Although a portfolio is rather informal, avoid:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A "play-by-play" of your path to reach the final goal: you may have worked hard on debugging something but (with a few exceptions) that is not relevant to the portfolio.</li>
<li>First-person narrative text about what you worked on in the project (versus information about the project itself).</li>
<li>Over-description of technical details (leave for git repository and auxiliary documentation).</li>
<li>Putting anything on your portfolio that you do not want an employer to see.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each portfolio post should link to a git repository with the source code/design files and detailed technical documentation.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Likewise the <code>README.md</code> in the git repository should link to your portfolio.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The amount of content should be proportional to the effort, time, and importance of each project:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While a winter project may be fully described by a single block diagram, for example, your final project
will likely require more description and a breakdown of various subsystems.</li>
<li>The first page or so of your portfolio should stand on its own to provide a complete picture of what you did:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Additional content that fills in some details can come afterwards, divided up with good section titles</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="org5addc22">Suggestions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5addc22">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Undergraduate, MSR hackathon, and independent projects great to have on your portfolio.</li>
<li>Each post should lead with the main purpose and a result summary, within a few seconds of seeing a project, the reader should understand what it is.</li>
<li>Imagine that you are reading 50 people's portfolio and you have given yourself 1/2 hour to do it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reading is a bad term here: skimming is better.</li>
<li>You need to catch the attention of the reader quickly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do you catch the reader's attention?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Have several posts so the portfolio does not look like an afterthought. The first impression of your page is ideally "Wow, this person has done a lot of projects".</li>
<li>Good Graphics: Let the main project page convey the gist of each project by providing a meaningful picture. It makes sense to spend some time creating
good graphics because these stand out and are usually the first part of a portfolio that a reader sees. Having poor graphics may cause somebody to stop
looking at your portfolio before reaching your content.</li>
<li>Minimal Effort: Scrolling down to see your projects is not minimal effort, nor is needing to move your mouse over an image to see a description.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do you retain viewers?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be concise.</li>
<li>Be grammatically correct.</li>
<li>Be easy to read.</li>
<li>Short paragraphs/sentences.</li>
<li>Hierarchical.</li>
<li>Graphics and videos.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your portfolio also needs to serve more in-depth readers:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Maybe a project you did is aligned with the reader's needs.</li>
<li>In this case, a reader may take a deeper look at a specific post. Your post needs to stand up to this scrutiny by having substantive content.</li>
<li>A hierarchical presentation format, coupled with being able to have even more in-depth information in git helps convert cursory readers into in-depth readers.</li>
<li>You are unlikely to get an in-depth view if you don't first catch the eye of someone taking a cursory look.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do you have a flair for design?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let it shine! But keep the website practical.</li>
<li>If web design is not interesting to you don't worry: simple clear content is effective too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Putting effort into items that show more effort like Custom URLs, Custom HTML, and unique design can leave a good impression:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Only if you do it well and put in the extra time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The more pre-canned and generic your portfolio looks, the more the burden is on your projects and videos:</li>
<li>Even a Wix portfolio can work:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But, be careful because it can also imply a level of carelessness (especially when compared to your peers).</li>
<li>Employers will know that you put less effort in to your portfolio than others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look at past MSR student portfolios for inspiration.</li>
<li>Look at your portfolio on different web browsers and on different devices, including a tablet or phone.</li>

<h2 id="orgf10bb16">How To Make A Portfolio</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf10bb16">
<p>
While the method of making a portfolio is up to you, MSR does have a suggested method that is
designed to balance flexibility, quality, and ease-of-updating. It takes some setup to get working
but, once setup, making new posts should be relatively straightforward.

<h3 id="org54bf0fa">Jekyll and Github Pages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org54bf0fa">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is the static site generator used by github pages and our recommended method for creating a portfolio.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A <i>static</i> website is a website that directly serves webpages to clients without the server dynamically changing the content of those pages</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You need not use Jekyll to use Github Pages, you can host any statically generated website with <a href="https://pages.github.io">github pages</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You could use another generator like <a href="https://hyde.github.io">Hyde</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> or even write your own HTML/CSS from scratch</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You need not use github pages to host your portfolio, although it is a convenient option.</li>
<li>Some past students have used their own domain with github pages for their portfolio or used alternative hosting services.</li>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://github.com/NU-MSR/msr-student-template">Student Template</a> to get started on creating a template portfolio
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is just a sample portfolio.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You should feel free to modify it liberally.</li>
<li>Putting effort into your portfolio design makes you stand out from the crowd.</li>
<li>There are many themes available, for example at  <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/">https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/</a></li>

<li>See <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">this guide</a></li>
<li>Although you can develop your own template, it is often easier to modify an existing template.</li>
<li>If one template is not working, do not spend too much time trying to fix it: instead choose another template.</li>
